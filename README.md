some text

## git branch
if we type git branch into the terminal... we see * master
*= the branch you are on
master= the branch name

## git checkout 
if we type //git checkout -b feature-readme-instructions
We will get a notification "Switched to a new branch 'feature-readme-instructions'

if we type 'git checkout master' => we will switch to master branch.

In essence, git checkout -b creates new branch, git checkout switches branches
